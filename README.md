# Saft.drupal7

This module contains the Saft library (+ vendors) and provides a Drupal integration. The Saft library is the aim to build a collection of components which helps anyone who wants to create applications by using Semantic Web technology.

## Installation

1. Download the [zip](https://github.com/SaftIng/Saft.drupal7/archive/master.zip)
2. Extract it
3. Rename the extracted folder from *Saft.drupal7-master* to **saft**
4. Move it into your Drupal modules folder (usually sites/all/modules/). So it is now located under sites/all/modules/saft, for instance.
5. Go to the backend and install the module. There is not really an installation, but that module can be an dependency to other modules, so it must be registered in the system.
6. Done. You can now start to use Saft inside your Drupal 7 installation.

## Getting started

You may want to have a look at the [Saft skeleton module](https://github.com/SaftIng/Saft.drupal7-skeleton). It provides a very basic structure which you can reuse to build your next Semantic Web-Ready-Drupal-7 module.
